# Techdegree-Project2
This is my Project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering.
Taking a list of 54 students and condensing the list to only show 10 students per page.
I am aiming for exceeds, as I have added a search bar which returns matches and also condenses reults to 10 per page (if applicable).
I noticed in the html there are repeating same images for different students spread throughout, which I was fine with... However, I was a little bugged there was one instance where the same avatar was repeated for 2 students back to back - so I went ahead and added myself to the list in place of one of the students, I hope that's ok =)
