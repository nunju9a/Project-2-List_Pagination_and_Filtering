# List Pagination and Filtering
- Received grade of "Exceeds Expectations"

This project takes a list of 54 students and condenses it to only show 10 students per page. Pagination links were dynamically created and appended to the DOM, as well as a functional search bar. The code is flexible enough to respond to lists of different lengths and paginate accordingly. Search feature returns matches, paginates results, and returns a "no results" message if there are no matches.
